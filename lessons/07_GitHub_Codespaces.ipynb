        "\n",
        "* Bash stands for \"Bourne Again SHell\" and is an improved version of the original Bourne Shell (sh)\n",
        "* It's the default shell in most Linux distributions and macOS (pre-Catalina)\n",
        "* Bash supports scripting, allowing you to automate tasks with scripts\n",
        "* It provides features like command history, tab completion, and command aliases\n",
        "* Bash uses environment variables to store system and user-defined settings\n",
        "* You can combine commands using pipes (|) and redirections (>, >>, <)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Common Bash Symbols and Their Meanings:\n",
        "  * `~` (Tilde): Represents the home directory of the current user\n",
        "    * Example: `cd ~` (navigates to your home directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `/` (Forward Slash): Directory separator in file paths\n",
        "    * Example: `/usr/local/` (absolute path to the local directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `.` (Single Dot): Refers to the current directory\n",
        "    * Example: `./script.sh` (runs script.sh from the current directory)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `..` (Double Dot): Refers to the parent directory\n",
        "    * Example: `cd ..` (moves up one directory level)\n",

        "\n",
        "  * `*` (Asterisk): Wildcard that matches any number of characters\n",
        "    * Example: `ls *.txt` (lists all files with .txt extension)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `?` (Question Mark): Wildcard that matches exactly one character\n",
        "    * Example: `ls file?.txt` (matches file1.txt, fileA.txt, but not file10.txt)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `>` (Greater Than): Redirects output to a file (overwrites)\n",
        "    * Example: `echo \"hello\" > file.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `>>` (Double Greater Than): Redirects output to a file (appends)\n",
        "    * Example: `echo \"world\" >> file.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `|` (Pipe): Sends the output of one command as input to another\n",

        "    * Example: `mkdir folder && cd folder`\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `;` (Semicolon): Separates multiple commands on the same line\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's turn your module into a proper Python package:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create an __init__.py File:\n",
        "   * In the my_module folder, create a new file called \"__init__.py\".\n",
        "   * Add the following code:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from .math_operations import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. About the __init__.py File:\n",
        "   * In Python, the `__init__.py` file serves several key purposes within a package:\n",
        "     * Package Initialization: When you import a package, the __init__.py file is executed, which allows you to initialize the package.\n",
        "     * Package Structure: It signifies that the directory containing the __init__.py file is a Python package.\n",
        "     * Module Imports: It allows you to control what is exposed when the package is imported.\n",
        "     * Subpackage Inclusion: If your package contains subpackages, each subpackage also requires its own __init__.py file.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The Relative Import Syntax:\n",
        "   * Notice the period (.) in front of math_operations in the import statement.\n",
        "   * In Python, the period is used for relative imports, allowing you to import modules relative to the current module's location.\n",
        "   * Types of Relative Imports:\n",
        "     * Single period (.): Refers to the current package or directory.\n",
        "     * Double period (..): Refers to the parent package or directory.\n",
        "     * Triple period (...): Refers to the grandparent package, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Test the Package:\n",
        "   * Modify main.py to use the package-style import:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Import from the package\n",
        "   from my_module import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Rest of the code remains the same\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Run the Updated Script:\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   python main.py\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   * The output should be the same as before.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Commit and Push Your Changes:\n",
        "   ```bash\n",

        "# Step 8: Import Your Module in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
        "\n",
        "When working in Jupyter notebooks, you might want to make changes to your module and immediately use those changes without restarting the kernel. Here's how to do that using `importlib`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, import your module and use it normally:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   from my_module import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n",
        "   \n",
        "   print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Now, if you make changes to your module files, you can reload the module using `importlib.reload()`:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import importlib\n",
        "   import my_module\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # After making changes to your module files\n",
        "   importlib.reload(my_module)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Now you can use the updated functions\n",
        "   from my_module import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n",
        "   \n",
        "   print(add(5, 3))  # Will use the updated version\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For more complex modules with submodules, you might need to reload each submodule:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   import importlib\n",
        "   import my_module.math_operations\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Reload the specific submodule\n",
        "   importlib.reload(my_module.math_operations)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Then reload the main module\n",
        "   importlib.reload(my_module)\n",
        "   \n",
        "   # Now import the updated functions\n",
        "   from my_module import add, subtract, multiply, divide\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows you to iteratively develop your module while testing it in the same notebook session.\n"
